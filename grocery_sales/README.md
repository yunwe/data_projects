##  Insights
<h3>Revenue Trends & Regional Seasonality</h3>
<h4>Revenue Trends</h4> 
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/revenue_trends_2.png" alt="Logo" width="600"/>
</p>
<p>
While total revenue appears to double in 1998, this is due to the inclusion of new data streams from Mexico and Canada.
After accounting for this expansion, the underlying organic <b>revenue trend remains remarkably steady</b> with minimal volatility.
</p>

<h4>Market Seasonality</h4>

Overall sales shows a clear Year-End peak in USA and Mexico, with performance increasing during November and December. This suggests high sensitivity to the Q4 holiday shopping season.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended to increase inventory and staffing during November and December to capture the proven seasonal surge.

<li><b>Profit Concentration: </b>A small segment of the inventory <b>(10% of products)</b> acts as the primary engine for profitability, contributing to <b>20% of total profit</b>. 
These high-performing items are concentrated within the High-Price and Mid-Price tiers.</li>
<li><b>Volume Leader: </b>Sales quantity for mid-price products is more than double the combined volume of the high and low-price tiers, indicating strong market fit and consumer demand in this segment.</li>
<li><b>Healthy Margin Range: </b>The product catalog maintains a strong profitability profile, with individual product margins ranging from a minimum of 49.02% to a high of 70.69%.</li>
<li><b>Underperforming SKU Identification: </b>We identified "Low-Performing" products as those with profit margins below 55% and low sales velocity. These items are candidates for decommissioning (removal) to optimize inventory costs and shelf space.</li>
<br>
<h3>Customer Segmentation and Demographics Analysis</h3>
<h4>Membership Tiers & Spending Behavior</h4>

  </tr>
</table>

<li><b>Revenue Drivers: </b>Bronze members are the primary revenue engine for the company, contributing more than double the total revenue of the next largest group (Normal members).</li>
<li><b>High-Value Segments: </b>While Bronze members lead in volume, Gold members represent the highest average spend per transaction.</li>
<li><b>Retention & Lifecycle Trends: </b>Gold Segment exhibits a significant "honeymoon period" in year one before spending patterns normalize to match other tiers. Bronze & Normal Segments show high stability and resilience, with average spending consistently fluctuating within a tight range of 160 to 180. Silver Segment consistently underperforms relative to other tiers, representing the lowest average spend across the membership lifecycle.</li>

<h4>Demographics & Socioeconomics</h4>
<table style="width: 100%;">

  </tr>
</table>

<li><b>Household Influence: </b>A strong positive correlation exists between the number of children in a household and average spending, suggesting that larger families are a key target demographic for bulk grocery purchases.</li>
<li><b>Age Distribution: </b>Engagement is consistent across all age groups (20–80). However, the 30–50 age bracket serves as the core "Power User" group, generating slightly higher total revenue than other demographics. </li>
<li><b>Income Distribution: </b>The customer base is predominantly Low-Income, representing 54% of the total population.</li>
<li><b>Geographic Concentration: </b>The market remains highly centralized, with 72% of the customer base residing in the USA.</li>
<br>

<h2>Actionable Recommendation</h2>  
Based on the data analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended to optimize revenue and operational efficiency:

<h3>Inventory & SKU Optimization</h3>

<li><b>Capitalize on the "Profit Powerhouses": </b> Since 10% of products generate 20% of total profit, the company should ensure 100% "in-stock" availability for these high-tier items to avoid lost revenue.</li>
<li><b>Streamline Underperformers: </b>Review products with a profit margin below 55% and low sales volume. These items should be considered for decommissioning to free up shelf space and reduce inventory holding costs.</li>

<h3>Targeted Marketing & Loyalty Programs</h3>

<li><b>Parent-Centric Campaigns: </b>Given the strong positive correlation between the number of children and average spending, marketing campaigns should focus on "family-sized" promotions and bulk-buy discounts.</li>
<li><b>Member Lifecycle Management: </b>Offer "Retention Rewards" to Gold Members after their first year to prevent the observed spending drop-off.</li>
<li><b>Low-Income Value Positioning: </b>With 54% of customers in the low-income bracket, maintaining competitive pricing on "Mid-price" essentials is critical for brand loyalty.</li>

<h3>Regional Strategy</h3>
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/avg_revenue_per_store.png" alt="Logo" width="800"/>
</p>

<li><b>Holiday Readiness: </b>Aggressively increase inventory and staffing in USA and Mexico during November and December to capture the proven seasonal surge.</li>
<li><b>Market Expansion: </b>Prioritize the expansion of stores in Canada, as it accounts for 17% of customer base but it serviced by only two stores. Despite the low store count, the average revenue per store in Canada exceeded both the USA and Mexico.</li>
